    <h3>Java 2022 Project: Bouncing Ball</h3>
    <p>
        My first programming project was done during my first year of university. We had to make a game using the physics engine library provided by the university. My particular game was inspired by a miniclip game called "The Red Ball", where the objective is to bypass many obstacles and navigate the red ball to it's intended target, which is the finish line. My game consists of 3 levels and each level progressively gets harder. You must collect every coin and gem and reach the door in order to progress to the next level.
